Bitcoin Staking and Yield Management Smart Contract
Overview
This smart contract manages Bitcoin (BTC) staking, liquidity pool management for BTC and USD, and leveraged BTC trading positions. It is designed to optimize yield strategies and ensure secure management of assets within the blockchain environment.

Features
Staking and Yield section
btcStakes: Tracks the amount of BTC staked by each user.

Functions:

stakeBTC(amount uint): Allows users to stake BTC tokens securely.

unstakeBTC(amount uint): Safely unstakes BTC tokens, ensuring that the amount being unstaked does not exceed the currently staked amount.

Liquidity Pool Management section
btcLiquidity: Manages the liquidity of BTC tokens.

usdLiquidity: Manages the liquidity of USD tokens.

Functions:

addLiquidityBTC(btcAmount uint, usdAmount uint): Adds liquidity to both BTC and USD pools efficiently.

removeLiquidityBTC(btcShares uint, usdShares uint): Withdraws liquidity from BTC and USD pools securely, ensuring that the requested shares are available for withdrawal.

BTC Trading with Leverage section
leveragedPositions: Stores leveraged trading positions for BTC.

Functions:

openLeveragedPosition(btcAmount uint, leverage uint): Initiates a leveraged trading position in BTC, specifying the amount and leverage.

closeLeveragedPosition(): Closes an active leveraged trading position in BTC.

liquidateLeveragedPosition(): Liquidates an active leveraged trading position, transferring the BTC amount to another specified address.

Usage
Deployment
To deploy this smart contract, compile it using a suitable blockchain development environment, ensuring compatibility with the target blockchain platform's virtual machine.

Interacting with the Smart Contract
Interactions with the smart contract can be performed through transactions initiated on the blockchain network. Users and applications can call the defined public functions (stakeBTC, unstakeBTC, addLiquidityBTC, removeLiquidityBTC, openLeveragedPosition, closeLeveragedPosition, liquidateLeveragedPosition) to stake BTC, manage liquidity pools, and initiate leveraged trading positions.

Security Considerations
Assertions: Functions include assertions to prevent operations that would lead to insufficient funds or liquidity issues.

Transaction Handling: Use of success and ok markers to indicate successful transaction execution.
