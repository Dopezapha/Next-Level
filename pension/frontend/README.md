## Component Overview

- `App.js`: Main component that manages routing between different dashboards
- `Header.js`: Navigation component for switching between user types
- `UserDashboard.js`: Interface for user actions (register, contribute, withdraw)
- `EmployerDashboard.js`: Interface for employer actions (contribute for employees, set employee-employer relationship)
- `AdminDashboard.js`: Interface for admin actions (update retirement age, add investment options, register employers)
- `InvestmentOptions.js`: Reusable component for selecting investment options
- `ErrorBoundary.js`: Component for catching and displaying unexpected errors

## Styling

The application uses a custom CSS file (`styles.css`) for styling. The design aims to be clean, professional, and responsive. Key style features include:

- Consistent color scheme using CSS variables
- Responsive layout for various screen sizes
- Clear visual hierarchy and spacing
- Interactive elements with hover and active states

## Error Handling

The application includes several layers of error handling:

- Component-level try/catch blocks for handling expected errors
- Loading states to indicate ongoing operations
- An ErrorBoundary component to catch and display unexpected errors
- User-friendly error messages displayed in the UI

## Future Improvements

- Implement actual smart contract interactions using ethers.js
- Add unit and integration tests
- Implement a state management solution (e.g., Redux, Context API)
- Enhance form validation
- Add user authentication and authorization
- Implement data caching for improved performance
- Add more detailed analytics and reporting features
